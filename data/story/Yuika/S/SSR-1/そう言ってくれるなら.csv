3007004020020,結華,……あれ。あのふたり……,Huh... That's...
3007004020030,恋鐘,"……おかしかねー
うちの記憶では確かにこっちなんよ","...What in tha heck?
I swear I remember it bein' 'round here."
3007004020040,霧子,この道……さっきも、通ったかも……,I think we might have... Gone down this road already...
3007004020050,結華,やっぱり……,Just as I suspected...
3007004020060,結華,"これはこれは、先日の王子様！
今日は可愛いお姫様まで連れちゃって、どしたのー？",Well look who it is! That charming prince I met the other day! I see she has cute princess in tow as well. I wonder why?
3007004020070,恋鐘,あ、結華！,"Howdy, Yuika!
"
3007004020080,恋鐘,"なんね、結華は王子なうちが気に入ったと？
霧子もおるし、また見せちゃろっか？","Didya like my prince impression that much? Since Kiriko ain't seen it yet, maybe I should do it again!"
3007004020090,霧子,お、王子様……？,P-Prince impression?
3007004020100,結華,"楽しそうだけど、また次の機会にとっておこうかな～
それよりさ、ふたりは揃ってお出かけ？　デート？","That does sound fun, but perhaps it's best saved for a different occasion! Anyway, what are you two doing out together? Is this a date?"
3007004020110,恋鐘,"そうたい！　今日は霧子とお茶してたとよ！
これから買い物もする予定ばい！","Darn right! Me an' Kiriko had tea together earlier. And now we're gonna do some shoppin'.
"
3007004020120,霧子,う、うん……そうなんだけど……,"Y-Yes... So we thought, but..."
3007004020130,結華,"何かお困りだったり？
さっきもあわあわしてたっぽかったけど",Is something the matter? You did seem a bit confused when I spotted you.
3007004020140,恋鐘,"うちらの心配してくれたん？　優しかねぇ
でも問題なかよ！　別に、困っとるってほどじゃなかと","Were ya worried 'bout us? Yer such a sweetheart. But there ain't no issue! Er, not enough of one that I'd say somethin's the matter."
3007004020150,恋鐘,ちょっとここがどこなのかわからんだけたい！,"We jus' have no darn idea where we are!
"
3007004020160,結華,"なるほどねぇ、こがたんってばポジティブ～！
……ちなみにきりりん、どこ行こうとしてたの？","I see. You always focus on the positive don't you, Kogatan~! ...Kiririn, why don't you start by telling me where you're trying to go?"
3007004020170,霧子,あ、えっと……本屋さんに、行きたくて……,"Ah, um... I wanted to go to a bookstore..."
3007004020180,恋鐘,"霧子、病院の患者さんたちにおつかい頼まれてたらしか
そん中に普通の本屋じゃ売っとらんものもあって",Kiriko got sent to pick up some books for patients at tha hospital. But summa tha books on her list weren't things they had at the usual bookstore.
3007004020190,恋鐘,"やけん、新しいお店ば探しとるところたい！
うちの勘では、もうすぐ着くと思うんやけど～","So we're tryna find another bookstore! Accordin' to my flawless intuition, we should be findin' one right 'bout now, but!"
3007004020200,結華,"ははぁ、冒険の途中だったってわけですか
だったらその旅、三峰も仲間に入れてよ","A-ha, so you're in the middle of an adventure. Why don't you let Mitsumine accompany you on this journey?"

3007004020230,霧子,ふふ、うん……！,"Eheh, yes...!"
3007004020240,霧子,"本のリストを……預かってて……
結華ちゃん、これでわかるかな……？","This is... the book list they gave me... Do you think you'll be able to find all of these, Yuika...?"
3007004020250,結華,見せて見せてー。……ふんふん。おっけー,Let's see here... Hmmm-hmmm. Okay.
3007004020260,結華,"何軒か回る必要ありそうだけど、多分揃うと思うよ
あ、古本屋は使っても大丈夫？","It looks we'll need to visit several different stores, but I think we'll be able to find everything. Oh, is it cool if we get some of these books used?"
3007004020270,霧子,"う、うん……！
ありがとう。結華ちゃん……すごいな……","Y-Yes...! Thank you, Yuika... You're incredible!"

結華は町の司書さんばい！","Yer amazin'! No matter what tha book, ya found it immediately! Yer practically the town librarian!"
3007004020320,結華,町の司書さんか、かっこいいねそれ！,"The town librarian, huh? Makes me sound pretty cool."
3007004020330,霧子,"結華ちゃん、本当に……かっこよかった……！
選んでくれた漫画とか……","You really were... So cool...!
And all this manga you picked out..."
3007004020340,霧子,"はやく……渡してあげたい
入院で、不安そうな子がいて……","I can't wait... to bring it to the hospital... There's a child there who seems very anxious, you see..."
3007004020350,結華,"ほんと？　なら良かった。……まぁ中身はともあれ、
きりりんの優しさには感動しちゃうんじゃないかな？","Is there? I hope they enjoy it... Well, regardless, I'm sure the patients will be very moved by your kindness, Kiririn. "
3007004020360,結華,喜んでもらえるといいねぇ,"Hopefully they'll be happy, too."
3007004020370,霧子,うん……！,Yes...
3007004020380,恋鐘,"せっかくやし、霧子は感想聞いてこんといかんね！
それにうちらも読んでみたか！","Since Yuika helped so much, ya gotta make sure to tell her what that kid thinks of tha manga she picked out! I might wanna read it too!"

もし酷評食らったら三峰のガラスのハートが割れちゃうから","Oh, no need for that! Mitsumine's fragile heart of glass might shatter if she heard that they hated it."
3007004020410,結華,ふたりの心の中で止めといて～,"Keep what they say between yourselves, please~!"
3007004020420,恋鐘,"なんをそんなに心配しとると？
結華が選んだの、全部面白そうだったばい！","Whatcha actin' so worried 'bout?
Everythin' ya picked out looked real good!"
3007004020430,霧子,う、うん……わたしもそう思う……,"Y-Yes... I thought so, too!"
3007004020440,結華,"──そっか
こがたんときりりんがそう言ってくれるなら充分だよ","──Really?
If you both say so, then I guess there's no reason to worry."
3007004020450,恋鐘,"……あ、ちょうどよか時間ばい
どこかでご飯にするとよ！","...Hey, it's 'bout dinner time, ain't it?
We should stop somewhere an' eat!"

優秀な道案内は美味しいご飯屋さんも紹介できるけど……",Absolutely! Your excellent tour guide can think of of several delicious restaurants in this area...
3007004020470,結華,"パスタが自慢のお店とデザートのサービスがつくお店、
どっちがいい？","Let's see. There's a restaurant that serves pasta as it's main dish, and a restaurant that has a dessert bar. Which would you prefer?"
3007004020480,恋鐘,"んんー……！　どっちも悩ましか……！
霧子、任せたばい！　霧子の好きな方でよか！","Hmmm! Ain't an easy choice!
Kiriko, you decide! Whichever one you like!"
3007004020490,霧子,"えっ……えっと……
ゆ、結華ちゃんに……おまかせです……！","Uh... Ummm!
Y-Yuika... I'll let you pick!"
3007004020500,結華,"あれっ戻ってきた！？
じゃあまぁ、デザートの方にしよっか！","Throwing it back to me, are we? Alright then, let's go to the one with the dessert bar!"
